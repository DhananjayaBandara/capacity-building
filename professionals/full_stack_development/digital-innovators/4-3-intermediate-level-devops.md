## 4.3. Intermediate Level: DevOps and Operations - Building Automated Pipelines and Managing Systems!

Welcome to the **Intermediate Level of DevOps and Operations**!  Congratulations on establishing your DevOps foundation – you're making great strides in automation! Think of this level as **constructing the automated assembly lines and installing the monitoring systems** within your DevOps factory, creating efficient workflows and gaining visibility into system health. Here, we'll take your foundational IaC skills and **expand them significantly**, dive into **Configuration Management in depth**, introduce **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines**, and build your understanding of **system monitoring and logging**. Get ready to build **robust automated software delivery pipelines** and become a proficient DevOps Engineer!

#### Intermediate Level for DevOps and Operations:  Orchestrating CI/CD and Gaining System Observability!

*   **Goal of the Intermediate Level:** The primary goal of the Intermediate Level is to **expand your DevOps skillset** to build **automated CI/CD pipelines**, master **Configuration Management**, and implement **basic monitoring and logging** for applications and infrastructure. We want you to be able to:

    *   **Master Advanced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform (or CloudFormation):** Deepen your IaC skills with a chosen tool (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation). You'll learn to manage more complex infrastructure configurations, implement modular IaC code, handle state management effectively, and utilize advanced features of the IaC tool.
    *   **Become Proficient in Configuration Management (CM) with Ansible (or Chef/Puppet):** Master a Configuration Management tool (like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet). You'll learn to automate software installation, configuration management, and ensure consistent configurations across servers using CM tools.
    *   **Design and Implement Basic Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipelines:** Learn the principles of CI/CD and gain hands-on experience setting up basic CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. You'll automate code building, testing, and deployment processes.
    *   **Implement Basic System Monitoring and Logging:** Learn the fundamentals of system monitoring and logging. You'll implement basic monitoring for infrastructure and applications using tools like Prometheus and Grafana (for monitoring) and ELK/EFK stack (for logging – Elasticsearch, Logstash/Fluentd, Kibana) at an introductory level.
    *   **Enhance Your DevOps Workflow and Collaboration:** Improve your DevOps workflow by implementing version control best practices for IaC and CM code, collaborating on DevOps projects using Git, and understanding basic DevOps collaboration workflows.
    *   **Build a Complete CI/CD Pipeline for a Sample Application as a Capstone Project:** Apply your IaC, CM, and CI/CD skills to build a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment of a sample application, showcasing your intermediate-level DevOps proficiency!
    *   **Strengthen Your Understanding of DevOps Security (Basic CI/CD Security Considerations):** Expand your understanding of DevOps security beyond basic concepts and learn about basic security considerations in CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation (secrets management, basic access control – without diving into advanced security yet).
    *   **Prepare for Advanced DevOps Architectures, Cloud-Native Concepts, and Scalability:** Build a strong intermediate DevOps skill set that will serve as a solid stepping stone to tackle the advanced DevOps topics, cloud-native architectures, and large-scale system management in the Advanced Level.

*   **Modules within the Intermediate Level:** To achieve these goals, we'll advance through these key modules in the Intermediate Level:

    1.  **5.1. Advanced Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Mastering Terraform (or CloudFormation):** (IaC mastery deepened!) Dive deep into advanced features of your chosen IaC tool (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation). Learn to manage complex infrastructure configurations, implement modules and reusable IaC code, handle state management effectively, and utilize advanced provisioning techniques.
    2.  **5.2. Configuration Management (CM) with Ansible (or Chef/Puppet) - Ensuring Consistency:** (CM automation unleashed!) Master a Configuration Management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, or Puppet). Learn to write playbooks/recipes/manifests to automate software installation, configure systems, manage services, and ensure consistent configurations across a fleet of servers.
    3.  **5.3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipelines - Automating Software Delivery:** (CI/CD pipelines in action!) Learn the principles of CI/CD and gain hands-on experience setting up basic CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. Automate code building, automated testing (basic unit and integration tests in the pipeline), and deployment processes to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
    4.  **5.4. Monitoring and Logging Fundamentals - Gaining Observability:** (System visibility!) Learn the fundamentals of system monitoring and logging in a DevOps context. Implement basic monitoring for infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network) and application performance metrics using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Set up basic logging infrastructure using tools like ELK/EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash/Fluentd, Kibana) to collect and analyze application and system logs (at an introductory level).
    5.  **5.5. Intermediate DevOps Project: CI/CD Pipeline for Application Deployment (Capstone Project - Intermediate Level):** (Building a complete delivery pipeline!) Apply your IaC, CM, and CI/CD knowledge to build a complete CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment of a sample application (e.g., a simple web application or API) to a cloud environment or local virtualized environment. This will be your capstone project for the Intermediate Level, showcasing your ability to orchestrate an automated software delivery workflow.

*   **Learning Approach at the Intermediate Level:** We'll build upon the beginner-friendly approach, continuing to increase complexity, encouraging more independent problem-solving, and emphasizing practical tool usage and workflow implementation:

    *   **Building on Beginner DevOps Fundamentals (Advanced Tooling and Workflows):** We'll assume a solid foundation in IaC basics from the Beginner Level and build upon that to master advanced IaC features, implement Configuration Management, and set up CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Tool-Focused Tutorials and Hands-On Labs for IaC, CM, CI/CD, and Monitoring:**  You'll work through tool-specific tutorials and hands-on labs that guide you through using Terraform/CloudFormation for advanced IaC, Ansible/Chef/Puppet for CM, Jenkins/GitLab CI/GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Prometheus/Grafana/ELK/EFK for monitoring and logging – focusing on practical application and tool mastery.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Design and Implementation Exercises:**  You'll learn to design basic CI/CD pipelines and implement them in a hands-on manner, understanding the stages of a pipeline, how to integrate testing, and automate deployment steps.
    *   **Configuration Management for Application Deployment and System Configuration:**  You'll use Configuration Management tools to automate the deployment of applications, configure server settings consistently, and manage software configurations across your infrastructure.
