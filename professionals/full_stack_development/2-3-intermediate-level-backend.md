## 2.3. Intermediate Level: Back-end Design and Development - Building Robust Server-Side Applications!

Welcome to the **Intermediate Level of Back-end Design and Development**!  Congratulations on building your server-side foundation â€“ you're making great progress! Think of this level as **constructing the walls and internal systems** of your back-end building, adding structure and sophistication to the solid base you laid in the Beginner Level! Here, we'll take your foundational server-side programming skills and **deepen them significantly**, explore **powerful server-side frameworks**, dive into **database interaction**, and learn to build **more robust and feature-rich back-end applications!** Get ready to build truly functional and scalable server-side systems!

#### Intermediate Level for Back-end Design and Development:  Crafting Functional APIs and Database-Driven Applications!

*   **Goal of the Intermediate Level:** The primary goal of the Intermediate Level is to **expand your back-end skillset** to build more **complex, data-driven, and functional server-side applications and APIs**. We want you to be able to:

    *   **Master a Server-Side Framework:**  Become proficient in using a powerful server-side framework (like Express.js for Node.js, Django for Python, or Spring Boot for Java). You'll learn how frameworks structure applications, handle routing, manage middleware, and simplify development.  (We'll likely focus on *one* framework at this level for a deep dive).
    *   **Design and Develop RESTful APIs:**  Learn to design and build RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) that are well-structured, efficient, and follow industry best practices. You'll understand API design principles, HTTP methods, request/response cycles in detail, and how to build APIs for front-end applications to consume.
    *   **Interact with Relational Databases using ORMs:** Dive into relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) and learn to interact with them programmatically from your back-end applications using Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs). You'll learn to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, design database schemas, and understand database relationships.
    *   **Implement User Authentication and Authorization:**  Learn to secure your back-end applications by implementing user authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (controlling access to resources). You'll explore common authentication methods (like session-based, token-based), and authorization patterns to protect your APIs and data.
    *   **Enhance Your Back-end Development Workflow:**  Improve your back-end development workflow by using more advanced debugging techniques, understanding basic testing principles for back-end code, and deepening your Git version control skills for collaborative back-end projects.
    *   **Build a Modular API with Microservice Components as a Capstone Project:**  Apply your framework, API design, database interaction, and security skills to build a more substantial modular API application, potentially exploring microservice concepts to structure your application. This will be your capstone project for the Intermediate Level.
    *   **Strengthen Your Understanding of Back-end Performance and Scalability (Basic Introduction):**  Gain an introductory understanding of back-end performance considerations and basic scalability strategies, preparing you for deeper performance optimization in the Advanced Level.
    *   **Prepare for Advanced Back-end Development Concepts and Architectures:** Build a strong intermediate skill set that will serve as a robust foundation to tackle the more complex and advanced topics in the Advanced Level.

*   **Modules within the Intermediate Level:** To achieve these goals, we'll advance through these key modules in the Intermediate Level:

    1.  **3.1. Server-Side Frameworks - Building Applications with Structure (e.g., Express.js, Django):** (Framework power unlocked!) Dive deep into a chosen server-side framework (e.g., Express.js or Django), learning its core features for routing, middleware, templating (optional for APIs), and how it structures back-end application development.
    2.  **3.2. Designing and Developing RESTful APIs - Building the Communication Layer:** (API mastery begins!) Learn the principles of RESTful API design, understand HTTP methods in detail, learn to design API endpoints, handle request and response formats (JSON), implement API documentation, and build well-structured and functional RESTful APIs.
    3.  **3.3. Database Interaction with ORMs (Relational Databases) - Connecting to Data:** (Database integration!) Dive into relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and learn to interact with them from your back-end code using ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers). You'll learn to perform CRUD operations, define database models/schemas, and manage database interactions within your applications.
    4.  **3.4. User Authentication and Authorization - Securing Your Back-end:** (Security foundations!) Learn to implement user authentication (verifying users) and authorization (managing access) in your back-end applications. Explore common authentication strategies, session management, token-based authentication (like JWT), and authorization patterns to secure your APIs and data.
    5.  **3.5. Intermediate Back-end Project: Modular API with Microservice Components (Capstone Project - Intermediate Level):** (Building a feature-rich API!) Apply your framework, API design, database interaction, and security skills to build a more complex and modular API application as your capstone project for the Intermediate Level.  This project may involve structuring your API using microservice principles to create independent and scalable components.

*   **Learning Approach at the Intermediate Level:** We'll build upon the beginner-friendly approach, continuing to increase complexity and encourage more independent problem-solving and deeper exploration of concepts:

    *   **Building on Beginner Fundamentals (Advanced Application):** We'll assume a solid foundation in server-side programming basics from the Beginner Level and build upon those fundamentals to implement more complex features and architectures using frameworks and databases.
    *   **Framework-Focused Tutorials and Practical Exercises:**  You'll work through framework-specific tutorials and practical coding exercises that focus on utilizing the chosen server-side framework to build structured applications and APIs.
    *   **API Design Principles and Hands-On API Building:**  We'll delve into API design principles with practical examples and hands-on exercises where you'll design and build RESTful APIs from scratch, learning to think about API contracts, request/response patterns, and API documentation.
    *   **Database Integration and ORM Usage - Real-World Data Management:**  You'll learn database concepts and ORM usage through real-world scenarios and practical exercises that involve designing database schemas, performing CRUD operations, and managing data within your back-end applications using an ORM.
    *   **Security Best Practices and Implementation - Securing Your Applications:**  We'll introduce security best practices in back-end development and guide you through implementing authentication and authorization in your applications, emphasizing secure coding practices.
    *   **Debugging and Basic Testing for Back-end Code:**  You'll learn more advanced debugging techniques specific to server-side code and be introduced to basic testing concepts and tools to start writing simple tests for your back-end logic.
    *   **Collaboration and Version Control (Git - Intermediate):**  We'll continue to emphasize Git for version control, using branching strategies for feature development, and practicing pull requests for code collaboration on back-end projects.
    *   **Integration of Supplemental Components (Continuing and Expanding):**  We'll continue to seamlessly integrate the Supplemental Components, now at an intermediate level:
        *   **Capstone Project (Modular API with Microservice Components):**  Will be a more substantial and challenging project, requiring you to design and build a more feature-rich and potentially microservice-based API, applying all intermediate-level skills.
        *   **Assessments (More In-Depth Code Reviews, API Design Evaluation, Security Checks, Database Schema Reviews):** Assessments will become more in-depth, focusing on code quality, API design principles, security implementation, database schema design, and adherence to framework best practices.
