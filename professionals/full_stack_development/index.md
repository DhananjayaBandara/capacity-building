# Mastering Full Stack, Cloud Native, and Secure Development: A Comprehensive Curriculum

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum designed to guide you through the exciting world of Full Stack, Cloud Native, and Secure application development! This curriculum is structured to take you on a progressive learning journey, starting from the fundamentals and advancing to expert-level skills. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this structured path will equip you with the knowledge and practical skills needed to build modern, secure, and scalable applications.

This curriculum is meticulously organized into key domains of modern application development, ensuring a holistic understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. We'll journey through front-end and back-end development, delve into database technologies, explore DevOps and operations, and integrate supplemental components that enhance every layer of your applications. Each module is designed to build upon the previous one, creating a cohesive and deeply enriching learning experience.

## What to Expect From This Curriculum:

This curriculum is divided into modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of full-stack development and further broken down by levels to cater to different stages of your learning:

* **Front-end Design and Development (Module 1):** We begin with the user interface, covering everything from basic web technologies and UI/UX principles to advanced JavaScript frameworks, CSS techniques, and web accessibility.
* **Back-end Design and Development (Module 2):** We then move to the server-side, exploring web servers, APIs, security best practices, advanced API design, microservices, and cloud-native architectures for robust and scalable back-ends.
* **Database Technologies (Module 3):** This module dives into data management, starting with database fundamentals, data modeling, and normalization, progressing to advanced SQL, NoSQL, ORMs, and database scalability and performance tuning.
* **DevOps and Operations (Module 4):** Essential for modern development, this module covers version control, CI/CD, containerization, infrastructure as code, monitoring, security, and SRE practices to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.
* **Supplemental Components Across All Layers (Module 5):** To round off your expertise, this module includes capstone projects, assessments, soft skills workshops, industry insights through guest lectures, and digital library integration to enhance your overall learning experience.

**Within each module**, you will find levels designed to progressively build your skills:

* **Beginner Level:**  Establish foundational knowledge and understand core concepts.
* **Intermediate Level:**  Develop practical skills and apply learned concepts to build functional components.
* **Advanced Level:** Master expert-level techniques and strategies for complex challenges and optimizations.
