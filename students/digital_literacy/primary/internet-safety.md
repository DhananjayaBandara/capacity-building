## Online Safety

### The Online World

The **internet** is like a giant library or a big playground where you can find lots of information, play games, and talk to friends. It connects computers and devices all around the world, making it easy to share and learn new things.

- **Websites and Apps**
  - **Websites** are like different rooms in the library. Each website has its own purpose, like learning, playing, or watching videos.
  - **Apps** are like special tools or toys you can use on your tablet or phone to do fun and useful things.

- **Online vs. Real Life**
  - People you meet online are still real, just like your friends in school. It's important to remember that what you do online can have real effects, just like your actions in real life.

### Safe Websites and Content

Staying safe online means choosing the right places to visit and knowing when to ask for help.

- **Recognizing Good Websites**
  - **Colorful and Friendly Designs:** Safe websites for kids often have bright colors and fun characters.
  - **Trusted Logos:** Look for logos or badges that show the website is safe and approved for children.

- **Asking an Adult**
  - Before clicking on any links, downloading something, or visiting a new website, always ask a parent or guardian. They can help you stay safe and find the best places online.

- **"Tricky" Websites**
  - Some websites are not meant for kids and might have content that’s not appropriate. If a website looks strange or makes you feel uncomfortable, leave and tell an adult right away.

### Personal Information

Keeping your personal information private is very important to stay safe online.

- **Keeping Secrets**
  - **Personal Information:** Your name, address, phone number, and passwords are private. Never share them with anyone online.
  
- **Talking to Strangers**
  - Just like in real life, you should be careful when talking to people you don't know online. If someone you don’t know tries to talk to you, tell a parent or guardian immediately.

### Screen Time and Balance

Using screens is fun, but it’s important to have a good balance with other activities.

- **Time Limits**
  - Set limits on how much time you spend on the computer, tablet, or phone each day. Make sure to also do other activities like playing outside, reading, and spending time with family and friends.

- **Taking Breaks**
  - Take regular breaks from screens to rest your eyes and avoid getting tired. Stand up, stretch, and move around to stay healthy.

### Positive Online Behavior

Being kind and respectful online helps make the internet a better place for everyone.

- **Being Kind Online**
  - Use polite words and be respectful when you chat or comment online. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

- **Asking for Help**
  - If you see something online that makes you feel scared or uncomfortable, tell a trusted adult right away. They can help you understand what’s happening and keep you safe.
